It is not meant to be used in production, but rather as a learning tool for those who are interested in learning how to build a simple MVC framework. It builds on the concepts of the [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com/). It uses the [Twig template engine](https://twig.symfony.com/) for rendering views. It uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for autoloading classes and [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) for testing. As front-end it uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).",
